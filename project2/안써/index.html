        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>“Unexpected moments captured in the span of 120 seconds”—this is the essence of time and place, encapsulated. Welcome to my BeReal archive, chronicling a journey from March 2022 to March 2024. Over these two years, I endeavored to seize the spectacular and the mundane, the adventures that unfolded and the quiet days in between. Life, with its unpredictable twists, often deviated from the planned path, presenting a tapestry woven with the threads of reality.</p>
        
        <p>In this collection, you’ll find an authentic representation of my existence. Yes, I am an introvert at heart, a homebody whose comfort zone often found me amidst the cozy chaos of bed and messy hair. Yet, each image, each spontaneous snapshot, serves as a window into the varied slices of my life.</p>

        <p>Dive into this personal odyssey, and perhaps, find reflections of your own unscripted moments. For those glimpses that resonate or spark curiosity, I invite you to connect with my daily realities on BeReal @gxtheo.</p>

        <p>Embark on this visual journey with me, through the candid, the serene, and the beautifully ordinary. Welcome to my life’s montage, framed within the bounds of authenticity. Enjoy the ride.</p>
