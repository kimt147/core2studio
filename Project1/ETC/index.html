        <p>So now to come to the real question of punctuation, <strong>periods</strong>, <strong>commas</strong>, <strong>colons</strong>, <strong>semi-colons</strong> and <strong>capitals</strong> and <strong>small letters</strong>.
            
            I have had a long and complicated life with all these. 
            
            Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are <strong>colons</strong> and <strong>semi-colons</strong>, one might add to these <strong>commas</strong>.
            
            When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had <strong>colons</strong> and <strong>commas</strong> to do with it, what had <strong>periods</strong> to do with it what had <strong>small letters</strong> and <strong>capitals</strong> to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had <strong>colons</strong> and <strong>semi-colons</strong> to do with it what had <strong>commas</strong> to do with it what had <strong>periods</strong> to do with it.
            
            What had <strong>periods</strong> to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then <strong>periods</strong> had to exist. Beside I had always like the look of <strong>periods</strong> and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in <strong>periods</strong> and I used them. I really never stopped using them.
            
            Beside that <strong>periods</strong> might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years ago <strong>periods</strong> had come to have for me completely a life of their own. They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them <strong>Periods</strong> could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as <strong>commas</strong> and <strong>colons</strong> and <strong>semi-colons</strong> do. Yes you do feel what I mean.
            
            <strong>Periods</strong> have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own. And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to <strong>periods</strong> so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
            
            You can see what an entirely different thing a <strong>period</strong> is from a <strong>comma</strong>, a <strong>colon</strong> or a <strong>semi-colon</strong>.
            
            There are two different way of thinking about <strong>colons</strong> and <strong>semicolons</strong> you can think of them as <strong>commas</strong> and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as <strong>periods</strong> and then using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as <strong>periods</strong> but I myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a <strong>comma</strong> and <strong>commas</strong> are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. <strong>Semi-colons</strong> and <strong>colons</strong> had for me from the first completely this character the character that a <strong>comma</strong> has and not the character that a <strong>period</strong> has and therefore and definitely I have never used them. But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the <strong>period</strong> and so it might have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more <strong>comma</strong> than <strong>period</strong> and so really I cannot regret not having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a <strong>comma</strong> but they are a <strong>comma</strong> all the same. They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the <strong>comma</strong> nature. And now what does a <strong>comma</strong> do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.
            
            What does a <strong>comma</strong> do.
            
            I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them.
            
            As I say <strong>commas</strong> are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A <strong>comma</strong> by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant.
