            <h1>Welcome to <b>Pixel Clear!</b></h1>
            <p>At Pixel Clear, we believe that every city has the potential to shine, free from the litter and pollution that obscure its natural beauty. Our mission is to revitalize urban spaces by clearing away the clutter, pixel by pixel, making our cities cleaner, healthier, and more vibrant places to live.</p>
            <p>Founded with the vision of merging creativity and impact, Pixel Clear is not just another charity. We engage our supporters through an interactive experience that lets you actively participate in the transformation of cityscapes. With our unique, game-like features, you can "clear away" digital debris, uncovering the beauty of iconic city landmarks as they appear cleaner and brighter with every click. Each action you take on the site is a step toward a cleaner reality, as donations directly contribute to environmental cleanup projects.</p>
            
            <h2><b>Our Mission</b></h2>
            <p>Our mission is straightforward: to promote environmental stewardship and city beautification through innovative, interactive technology.
